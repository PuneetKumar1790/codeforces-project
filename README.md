## 🧠 What is NutriLens?

NutriLens is an AI-powered tool that helps users understand the nutritional quality of packaged food—just by uploading a photo of the product's backside (ingredients + nutrition label).

Using advanced vision-language models, NutriLens extracts information and instantly rates the product’s healthiness on a scale of 1 to 10, along with a simple explanation.
